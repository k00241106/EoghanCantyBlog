                            <p>Welcome to my blog! In this blog I will be discussing the development through each stage of each month of the Final Year Project. As part of my study of the Interactive Digital Media course at the Limerick Institute of Technology I must develop a digital media based project. This counts as a module in my course. This module is worth a total of 20 credits and will be completed across both semester one and semester two. Students can come up with any idea as they wish as long as it is built using digital media technologies. 
                            </p>
							
                            <p>So, my proposed solution is The F1 Guide (thef1guide.ie). This is the name I have chosen for my brand. The name chosen for this brand was extensively thought through. The name of this website and brand had to be researched quite a bit because I needed something that would constantly remind users of the subject they are looking for and also that would appeal to Search Engine Optimization (SEO). The F1 Guide is an educational website/AR experience. The website is a typical news website however with an emphasis on consumable content that would appeal to new fans of Formula 1 but also to the minority of Irish F1 fans that don’t have this experience available to them at this current time. The target market would be young people, however the content would ideally suit everybody. The AR application would be similar to a car customizer app. It is a markerless based AR app that will educate users on all various types of components relating to F1 from the rule flags to the in-depth technology of the cars. There are two parts to this project: the website and the augmented reality application. Below I will talk about each in detail.
                            </p>
                            <p>As explained above, involved on the website will be consumable content for eager new viewers to read, watch and listen to. Writing clever and detailed articles while keeping it simple is the goal here. Titles that capture people with smart images is what users will be looking for. With the use of SEO tools such as SEMrush this has allowed me to understand what Irish people are looking up in regard to F1 content. As part of my research understanding these keywords, articles aren’t always the best way to explain these questions on user’s minds. Uploading videos onto YouTube would be a great way to appeal to fans especially younger fans. As explained above as well I would like to have an ecommerce extension onto this website. As I have built ecommerce platforms in the past, I would have a quick and easy way to build this part of the brand. As part of creating a logo for my brand I would make some simple merchandise to sell. Implementing a Stripe or PayPal API will allow this ecommerce store to be fully operational. For legality purposes I would obviously set all these products to out of stock as I actually don’t plan to sell any. However, thanks to modern web technologies such as Google Analytics and Tag Manager I will be able to see if this has potential to be successful. Implementing the Google Analytics API and Tag Manager will provide excellent insight that even a lot of Irish business still struggle to monitor in this digital age we live in. To manage the overall website, I will set up an admin account. As I plan to have interaction with articles such as comments, removing any unfit comments will have to be done. This admin account will also be able to manage the ecommerce part by adding, updating and deleting products, orders and user accounts. It is also key to note that the website would not be a current news website for everything up to date F1. This would be too demanding to write constant articles by myself trying to keep up with everything F1. On the website I plan to have strictly History, educational and some party content such as quizzes but this is not priority yet.
                            </p>
							<p>The Augmented Reality application is something I am really excited to build as there is nothing like this amongst even worldwide competitors let alone Irish ones. My goal here is to build a markeless AR application. Ideally this app would be used outside but in Ireland we don’t always have the best luck in regard to weather. In this case using the app in any room with some open floor space makes it work to its full potential. Once users have opened the app, they can interact with the interface to select a component out of many I hope to have. I want to explain said component in a clear but also detailed manner. Take a flag for instance. If a user selects the red flag. I would hope to display a 3D model of the flag along with a text box explaining what the flag is and the rules behind it. As I said this would only be a small example of the many things I would like to implement. Thanks to some project management from myself I plan to limit the amount of work I have to do. Thanks to some very small differences in the makeup of F1 cars I will use a standard modern F1 car model and use this for each team. I would obviously texture each team differently to understand the difference between the teams and cars which is something I would also hope to show off.

							<p>Overall, I am looking forward to starting this project. The next part of this project will involve creating a gantt chart so I can manage the project timeline efficiently. After this I will build out my research report. This will be quite a long task and will take me the whole month to complete. </p>

                                I am a 21 4th year student currently studying Interactive Digital Media at the Technological University of the Shannon Midlands Midwest.
