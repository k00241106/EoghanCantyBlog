                            <p>For the final entry of the month I have a number of things to finish off. I have to do the wireframes, interface design and the actual presentation. The first asset I started doing was the wireframes. After looking at my moodboard I considered the layouts I had put in the board. These were similar to American news websites which is what I wanted to achieve. This can be reflected in my wireframes. The article page especially has this type of layout. The main article heading which is above the fold followed by sub articles. The main article is always going to be the most recently published article. The wireframes in total were an excellent way for me to start seeing how my website will look. I also did wireframes for my AR app. These wireframes were especially important as I had to ensure the user experience was fluid here because as explained in my research report that AR apps are very underused. Because of this people will not be used to traditional design techniques. In these wireframes I only had a limited number of screens. The screens were very carefully designed with limited call to actions especially in the drive screen. By the end I was quite happy with these wireframes and I think that I will be able to carry these over to an impressive looking interface design. For my interface design I simply had to carry over the design I had achieved in my wireframe. The only thing I had to come up with the was the correct colour scheme for my website. For my design I chose a blue navigation bar. The reason for this was due to how colour psychology (which can be seen in my research report) plays out but also down to my target audience which is mainly dominated by men but with a minor female influence. These colours are very much appreciated by both genders. The font I used throughout my website will be Roboto. I have used Roboto for quite a while now and I enjoy many aspects of it. The way it can be loaded in using Google fonts is a big positive for me. The interface design in the end is something I was quite happy with however, I wish I did have more time to refine it. Applying more appropriate imagery or playing around with different layouts would have been nice. Finally, I moved onto my presentation. In this presentation we only had five minutes to present. Because of this it would not be possible to show off everything. I had to pick carefully what I wanted to show. In the end I had six categories to show off. These were: moodboard, user interface design, user experience, personas and colour and typography. In the moodboard category I obviously showed off my moodboard that I talked about in the last entry. For my user interface design I talked about the interface design that I just went through above. The user experience was an interesting category I had to present. In this category I had to explain the user journey for a given use case. For example, read an article. The user would start at the home page click on the article element in the nav bar followed by the article of the userâ€™s choice once they arrive on the article page. I used arrows to show the audience the process in which the user would have to go through. The other categories were very straight forward and nothing notable to mention.
							</p>
							<p>To conclude, this month has been another very difficult month. This month was probably more difficult than the last month. This was mainly due to the Christmas period coming up in which all of the final assignments for each module are being issued or deadlines have come up. In the end I was reasonably happy with my design presentation. I am confident this design will be appealing to my prospecting users which will offer them the best experience.

                                I am a 21 4th year student currently studying Interactive Digital Media at the Technological University of the Shannon Midlands Midwest.
